# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Here is the R code and the documentation for the Data Science track course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

As required by the assignment:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The following files are present in this repository.

"CodeBook.md"" that describes how to use the variables and the data, and how transformations were performed to clean up the data.

"run_analysis.R"" contains the code.

The output of the 5th step is called "tidydata.txt"
